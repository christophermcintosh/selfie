<h1>Selfie</h1>

<p> A fun web app that uses the FacePlusPlus API to detect faces
                    through images taken directly with your webcam. After taking
                    a selfie, it will print your gender, age, ethnicity and your
                    current emotion. All images can then be downloaded to your
                    computer.</p>
